        <h1>Kuch Alfaz from Your Almost‑Hubby👉🏻👈🏻💕 ✍️</h1>
        <p>
          These are small pieces of my heart, written for the girl who turns my
          ordinary days into something worth remembering – you, Hadia.

          <h2>To My Sensitive Queen</h2>
          <p>
            My Sweetie Pie, I know your heart is gentle and your feelings are
            deep. I know words can stay with you for a long time. So hear this
            and keep it with you: you are not “too much”, you are not “hard to
            love” – you are exactly the kind of soul my heart prayed for.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the world feels heavy, I want you to remember that somewhere, a
            boy is quietly carrying your name in his prayers and asking Allah to
            keep your heart soft, safe and happy.

          <h2>From Your Future Hubby🫴🏻Khan💖</h2>
          <p>
            I may not have the ring on your finger yet, but my heart already
            treats you like my wife. I worry for you, care for you, get jealous,
            get scared to lose you, and keep dreaming of a home where you are in
            every corner.
          </p>
          <p>
            One day, Insha’Allah, I will look at you and say “we made it,
            Wifeyy” – no more long distance, no more screens, just you and me
            sharing a life that we used to talk about in messages and calls.

          <h2>Even When I Get Mad… On Mari Cutie Si Jaan🥺</h2>
          <p>
            Sometimes I get angry🥺, sometimes I say things I should not, but even
            in those moments my heart is still in love with you💕💗. My anger comes
            and goes, but my love for you stays Forever💗💖, grows and becomes more serious
            every day💟💞.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I ever hurt you, know that it hurts me too, because you are the
            last person on Earth that I want to see sad – especially because of
            me.

          <h2>Waiting for Jannah with You💖</h2>
          <p>
            I do not just want this life with you, Hadia. I want the life after
            this one too. I want us walking in Jannah, laughing about how we
            survived distance, tests, and all the hard days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Until that day, I will keep loving you from here, praying for you
            from here, and waiting for the moment when Allah writes our names
            together in the same story forever........ Read last line👇🏻👇🏻
