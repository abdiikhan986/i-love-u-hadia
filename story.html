        <h1>Our Beautiful Long‑Distance Story 💫</h1>
        <p>
         It all started on an ordinary day in May 2024…💞 
         a day that looked completely normal from the outside,
          but life had already planned something magical.💞💗💟 
          A guy was sitting with his books, 
          trying to prepare for his Computer Science exam.💕💖 
          He was tired, bored, and honestly just done with studying.💖😊💟
           To give his mind a break, he opened his laptop and casually went on OmeTV — not expecting anything, 
           not looking for anything… just passing time.

        </p><h4>But destiny doesn’t knock loudly🔊. It comes silently🤫💕💗💖.</h4>
        <p>
          Just when he was about to close the website, someone appeared on his screen — a cute, sweet little princess.💕💖💟💟💗💗
           One look… one smile… and everything paused for a moment.
            They started talking, and suddenly conversations felt effortless, time felt useless, and the world around them stopped mattering.
             Minutes turned into hours, and both of them didn’t even realize how fast the night slipped away.💟💖💕💕

Before leaving, they exchanged Instagram IDs. And that’s where the real magic started. Their chats became longer, softer, deeper. Slowly, without forcing anything, feelings started growing. He admired her intentions, her gentle heart, her qualities, and the way she cared. She was sensitive, an overthinker, an overobserver — but to him, she was perfect exactly as she was. He began to think about her all the time, about how to make her happy, how to protect her peace, how to love her right.

Even though they were far apart, something strong tied their hearts together. He knew he would never leave her, no matter what life threw at them. He wanted to do everything she loved and avoid everything she disliked — just to see her smile.

And now… it’s time to reveal the truth.
<br>

That guy… is me — Abdullah Khan.💗💞 <br>
And that sweet little princess… is you — Hadia💞, My Jaan💞💞💗🥺🥺. <br>

Our story began accidentally,💗💞💞💟💟💟 but, <br> it continues with intention,😊💖💟 love, and a future that InshaAllah we’ll live side by side,💗💖💕 forever.

          <h2>Only One After My Mom 💖💗💗</h2>
          <p>
            In my life there are only two queens: my mom and you. After my mom,
            you are the only girl my heart chose, the only girl I truly love,
            the only girl I see standing next to me in front of Allah as my
            wife.
          </p>
          <p>
            I do not need a thousand people. I just need one soul that feels
            like home – and that will always be you, my Sweetie Pie.
          </p>

          <h2>Far in Miles, Close in Heart💗💞😊</h2>
          <p>
            Yes, we are in a long‑distance relationship. We cannot share the
            same cake, we cannot hold hands on your birthday, and I cannot place
            a real crown on your head today. But I can still love you loudly,
            fiercely and loyally from here.
          </p>
          <p>
            This website is my way of touching your heart through a screen – a
            small reminder that even when you feel alone, someone is still
            whispering your name in every dua.

        <h2>Until My Last Breath… and Beyond😊💞💗</h2>
        <p>
          My love, I promise I will wait for the day when I can call you not
          just “Haduu” or “Wifeyy” for fun, but my real wife, in front of
          everyone and in front of Allah.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to love you until I take my last breath, and even after death,
          I want to be the one waiting for you when you arrive – so we can start
          our endless life together in Jannah, with no distance, no goodbyes,
          only peace and love.
