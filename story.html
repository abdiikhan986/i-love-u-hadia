        <h1>Our Beautiful Long‑Distance Story 💫</h1>
        <p>
          It all started on an ordinary day in May 2024… 
          a day that looked completely normal from the outside, 
          but life had already planned something magical.
          A guy was sitting with his books,
          trying to prepare for his Computer Science exam. He was tired,
          bored, and honestly just done with studying. 
          To give his mind a break, he opened his laptop and casually went on OmeTV — not expecting anything, not looking for anything… just passing time
        </p>
        <p>
          Distance tried to scare us. Screens tried to come between us. Time
          zones tried to confuse us. But somehow, you still became my safe
          place, my comfort, my favorite notification, and my calm after every
          storm.

          <h2>Only One After My Mom 🖤</h2>
          <p>
            In my life there are only two queens: my mom and you. After my mom,
            you are the only girl my heart chose, the only girl I truly love,
            the only girl I see standing next to me in front of Allah as my
            wife.
          </p>
          <p>
            I do not need a thousand people. I just need one soul that feels
            like home – and that will always be you, my Sweetie Pie.
          </p>

          <h2>Far in Miles, Close in Heart</h2>
          <p>
            Yes, we are in a long‑distance relationship. We cannot share the
            same cake, we cannot hold hands on your birthday, and I cannot place
            a real crown on your head today. But I can still love you loudly,
            fiercely and loyally from here.
          </p>
          <p>
            This website is my way of touching your heart through a screen – a
            small reminder that even when you feel alone, someone is still
            whispering your name in every dua.

        <h2>Until My Last Breath… and Beyond</h2>
        <p>
          My love, I promise I will wait for the day when I can call you not
          just “Haduu” or “Wifeyy” for fun, but my real wife, in front of
          everyone and in front of Allah.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to love you until I take my last breath, and even after death,
          I want to be the one waiting for you when you arrive – so we can start
          our endless life together in Jannah, with no distance, no goodbyes,
          only peace and love.
